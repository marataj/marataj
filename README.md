## Hi there 👋

My name is Mateusz and I'm a Python Software Engineer, with an electronics background.

🔭 As a Software Engineer at ZF Group, I'm working on applications for automated cybersecurity tests.

🌱 I enjoy processing data, analyzing it, and drawing conclusions from it.

☕ Besides programming, I enjoy gym, swimming and reading books in my free time.
