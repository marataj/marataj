## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mateusz and I'm a Python Software Engineer, with an electronics background.

ðŸ”­ As a Software Engineer at ZF Group, I'm working on applications for automated cyber security tests.

ðŸŒ± I like learning new technologies by working on side projects.

â˜• Besides programming, I enjoy gym, swimming and reading books in my free time.
